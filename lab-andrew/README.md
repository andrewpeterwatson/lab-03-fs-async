## To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository

  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas

## Description:
* For this assignment you will need to read three files and console log the first 8 bytes in hex of each file.  
* Also, you must guarantee that three files are read and console logged in the order `'one.txt', 'two.txt', 'three.txt'` regardless of file size.
* You can use any method of handling async except nested callback. aka. dont use nested calls to `fs.readFile` with anynomus function callbacks
* You will need to write tests that gaurantee that the files are logged in order.
* You will also need to look up and implement async testing, making sure that you are not getting "false positives"(tests that are passing but shouldn't be).

##Rubric:
  * Async Handling: 4pts
  * Use of fs: 2pts
  * Testing: 4pts
